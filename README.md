# Getting Data via Web APIs with R

A short tutorial on getting web data via APIs using R and the {httr2} package. In addition to this README, this project's repository contains two files:
* an R markdown file (.rmd), and
* a corresponding HTML output file (the result of an R Studio knit).

This demonstration uses two publicly available APIs:
* [UK Parliament](https://developer.parliament.uk/), and
* [US National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

Example one has users get information from Parliament's annunciator at a specific timepoint then further information on the speaker at that moment in time. Building on a [tutorial by Albert Rapp](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/web_dev/07_httr2_ultimate_guide/07_httr2), example two has users get time series weather data for a geographical point in the USA and plot the changing temperature.

To view this tutorial, navigate to its [corresponding GitHub webpage](https://ross-coron.github.io/APIs-with-R/). Alternatively, knit the R markdown file in R studio, download the HTML file and view it in a web browser such as Chrome.
